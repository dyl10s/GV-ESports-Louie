# GV-ESports-Louie

This is a discord bot created for Grand Valley's ESport's discord server.

## Getting Started

If you would like to run this server on your own PC, you will need to create an App.Config file in your local folder. In that app.config folder, use this code below:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key ="token" value="REPLACE WITH YOUR TOKEN"/>
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

### Prerequisites

To install this App.Config file

## Running

Once this application is up and running, you should see a window pop up. If it says ready, you have successfully connected!
